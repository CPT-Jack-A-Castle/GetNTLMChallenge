# GetNTLMChallenge

Obtains a NetNTLMv2 hash of the current user. This is just a slightly modified version of Vincent Le Toux's project at https://github.com/vletoux/DetectPasswordViaNTLMInFlow/.  The same thing can also be accomplished now via Elad Shamir's Internal-Monologue(https://github.com/eladshamir/Internal-Monologue).
